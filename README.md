# pycuda

GPU linear algebra functions callable from Python

Example how to use high-performance GPU libraries such as Cublas or Magma with Python using Pybind11 
Pybind11: https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Create a simple Python module that can be imported in any project.
CPU libraries Eigen are also supported, as well as the possibility to add Cuda kernels in .cu files.
Requirements and precisions can be found in the CMakeLists.txt file provided that can be adapted to other Linux configurations. 

Further support for cublas functions, as well as automatic Python-side documentation will be added.
